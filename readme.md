Testing
=======

# Why?
  * verify that our code does what we want, in a repeatable, automated way
    * alternative is manually running the code -- works fine for small problems but each time you add a feature, you have one more thing to manually test, and you need to test everything to make sure you didn't break anything that was working before

# How?
  * in Ruby, we use rspec. (other languages have other testing frameworks)
    * rspec is a ruby gem, so we should specify which version we're targeting in a Gemfile, so people running our code later know which version we were using
  * rspec looks like this:
```
  describe "general thing you're testing" do
    it "does specific thing you care about" do
      expect(some_function_call()).to eq expected_result
    end
  end
```


# Things we talked about
* Gemfiles (documenting which gems you used for future developers using your code)
* .rspec files (need to be in the directory where you're running rspec, put any flags you always want to use there, namely -fd for the documentation)
* passing blocks and yielding
* custom errors for making your errors more intuitive for users of your code
